1. Heat [[olive oil]] in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add [[stew beef, cut into cubes]] and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate, leaving the juices in the pan.

2. Add [[large onion, chopped]] and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 6 minutes. Stir in [[garlic, minced]] and [[fresh ginger, peeled and minced]] and cook for 1 minute more.

3. Stir in:

- [[butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 1/2 cups)]]
- [[no-salt-added diced tomatoes]]
- [[no-salt-added tomato sauce]]
- [[low-sodium beef broth]]
- [[ground cumin]]
- [[red pepper flakes]]
- [[ground cinnamon]]

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the beef and squash are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.

4. Divide [[cooked whole-wheat couscous (or small pasta or rice)]] among 4 bowls. Ladle the stew over the top and finish with [[sliced almonds, toasted in a dry skillet until golden]] and [[fresh parsley, minced]].
