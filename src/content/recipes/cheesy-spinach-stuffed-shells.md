1. **Make the sauce:** combine the following in a medium saucepan and simmer for 10-15 minutes:

- [[crushed tomatoes]]
- [[dried oregano]]
- [[dried basil]]
- [[salt]]
- [[pepper]]
- [[sugar]]

2. While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook [[large pasta shells]] al dente according to package directions. Drain and immediately place them in an even layer on paper towels or parchment.

3. **Prepare the filling:** in a medium bowl, stir together:

- [[cottage cheese]]
- [[part skim ricotta cheese]]
- [[freshly grated Parmesan cheese]]
- [[shredded mozzarella cheese]]
- [[salt]]
- [[pepper]]
- [[dried parsley]]
- [[dried oregano]]
- [[dried basil]]
- [[frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry]]

4. Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread half of the sauce evenly in the dish. Fill each shell with about 1/4 cup of filling and arrange in three rows of eight.

5. Pour the remaining sauce evenly over the shells. Cover with foil and bake for 35–40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 5 minutes.

6. Remove from the oven and let the shells rest for 5–10 minutes before serving.
