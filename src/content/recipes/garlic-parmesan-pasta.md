1. **Prep the ingredients.** Grate [[Parmesan cheese, finely grated]] and let it come to room temperature.

2. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt **2 tablespoons** of [[Butter, divided]].

3. Add [[Fresh garlic, minced]] and cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. Pour in [[Chicken broth]] and [[Optional seasoning mix (onion powder, oregano, thyme, parsley, pepper)]]. Slowly add [[Milk]] while stirring. Bring to a boil.

5. Add [[Angel hair pasta]]. Break in half if needed or use tongs to gently fold it in as it softens.

6. Let simmer 4–5 minutes, stirring occasionally so noodles don’t stick. Reduce the heat to low.

7. Add the remaining **1 tablespoon** of [[Butter, divided]] and toss to coat.

8. Gradually sprinkle in [[Parmesan cheese, finely grated]], stirring continuously until melted and smooth.  
   _Sauce will thicken as it stands and pasta absorbs liquid._

9. Sprinkle with [[Fresh parsley, chopped]] and serve warm.
