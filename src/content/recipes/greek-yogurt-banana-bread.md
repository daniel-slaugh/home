1. **Prep**

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a standard loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.

⸻

2. **Mix the wet ingredients**

In a large bowl, mash the [[ripe bananas, mashed]] until mostly smooth.

Whisk in:

- [[vanilla Greek yogurt]]
- [[butter, melted]]
- [[eggs]]
- [[Splenda brown sugar blend]]
- [[vanilla extract]]

Mix until smooth and well combined.

⸻

3. **Mix the dry ingredients**

In a separate bowl, whisk together:

- [[all-purpose flour]]
- [[baking soda]]
- [[salt]]

⸻

4. **Make the batter**

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined.

Do not over mix — this keeps the bread tender.

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.

⸻

5. **Bake**

Bake for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

If the top begins browning too quickly around the 40-minute mark, loosely cover with foil and continue baking.

⸻

6. **Cool and serve**

Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, slice, and serve.
