1. **For the marinade,** in a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together the oil, lime zest, lime juice, cumin, coriander, soy sauce, salt, sugar, curry powder, coconut milk, and cayenne pepper.

2. Pour half the marinade into a bowl or container; cover and refrigerate for later.
3. Place the chicken in a large Ziploc bag or shallow dish, pour the remaining marinade over the chicken, seal or cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.
4. **For the rice,** bring the rice, coconut milk, water, and salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 16 minutes without lifting the lid. Remove from heat, let stand for 5–10 minutes, then fluff lightly before serving.
5. **For the chicken,**, preheat a grill to medium-high heat (about 375 °F on a pellet grill).
6. Grill the chicken 6–7 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until an instant-read thermometer inserted at the thickest part registers 165 °F.
7. While the chicken cooks, heat the reserved marinade on the stovetop or in the microwave until warm (avoid overheating to prevent separation).
8. Drizzle the warm sauce over the grilled chicken, serving extra sauce on the side.
9. Sprinkle fresh cilantro over the chicken and serve everything over the coconut rice with fresh lime wedges.
