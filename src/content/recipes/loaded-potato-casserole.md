1. **Roast the potatoes**

Preheat the oven to 425°F.

Toss [[Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed]] with [[olive oil]], [[salt]], and [[black pepper]]. Spread in an even layer on a large baking sheet.

Roast for 30–35 minutes, stirring once, until golden and tender.

Roasting gives richer flavor than boiling and prevents watery potatoes.

⸻

2. **Prepare the creamy base**

While the potatoes roast, add the following to a large heat-safe bowl:

- [[butter, melted]]
- [[sour cream]]
- [[garlic powder]]
- [[smoked paprika]]

Whisk until smooth and fully combined.

⸻

3. **Combine the potatoes and cheese**

Add the hot roasted [[Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed]] directly to the creamy base.

Lightly mash—rustic and chunky, not smooth.

Fold in:

- [[sharp cheddar cheese, shredded]]
- [[green onions, thinly sliced]]
- [[bacon bits]]

Taste and adjust [[salt]] if needed.

⸻

4. **Assemble the casserole**

Lightly butter a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Spread the potato mixture evenly into the dish.

⸻

5. **Add the topping**

Sprinkle evenly over the top:

- [[cheddar cheese, shredded]]
- [[Parmesan cheese, grated]]
- remaining [[bacon bits]]

This creates a crisp, savory contrast to the creamy interior.

⸻

6. **Bake**

Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Bake uncovered for 20–25 minutes, until bubbling and golden.

⸻

7. **Finish and serve**

Right before serving, scatter remaining [[green onions, sliced]] over the top and finish with a light grind of [[black pepper]].

The fresh green onions brighten the richness of the dish perfectly.
