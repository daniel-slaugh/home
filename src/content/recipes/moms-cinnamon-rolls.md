1. In a large bowl, combine:

- [[active dry yeast]]
- [[very warm water]]
- [[granulated sugar]]
- [[freshly ground whole wheat flour]]

Adding the whole wheat at this step lets it sponge so the finished rolls are more moist. Freshly grinding the whole wheat flower makes a world of difference in the end taste. If you can't grind your own, use the newest bag you can find.

2. Let sit for about 15 minutes until foamy. Then stir in:

3. Gradually mix in [[all-purpose flour (10 to 12 cups, as needed)]] until the texture is just right.
   The perfect texture is more stiff than soft (closer to pizza dough than bread dough). A good test is to touch it with you finger and it should still stick a little - but if you have oil on your finger, it doesn't stick.

4. Spread the dough out with your hands into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.

5. Spread the [[butter, softened]] evenly across the dough rectangle. The butter should be very soft but not runny.

6. Sprinkle a generous layer of [[granulated sugar]] over the butter. The right amount of sugar should all be held by the butter (not so much sugar that it's loose) but enough that you pretty much can't see the dough.

7. Sprinkle a generous layer of [[ground cinnamon]]. You don't want to see the sugar.

8. Roll up tightly and slice into 1-inch pieces. Kitchen shears work great for this.

9. Place rolls on greased baking sheets, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour (or bake sooner if you prefer a shorter rise).

10. Bake at 400°F for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden.

11. Mix all frosting ingredients together until smooth:

- [[butter, softened]]
- [[cream cheese, softened]]
- [[vanilla extract]]
- [[powdered sugar]]
- [[milk]]

Adjust the consistency if needed (more powdered sugar for thicker, more milk thinner). You'll want it a little on the thick side since the warm rolls will warm it up and thin it a bit.

12. Frost the rolls while warm.
