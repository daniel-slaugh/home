1. In a large bowl, combine:

- [[active dry yeast]]
- [[warm water]]
- [[vegetable oil]]
- [[granulated sugar]]

Let sit for about 15 minutes until foamy.

2. Stir in [[eggs]] and [[salt]]. Add [[whole wheat flour (optional, up to 3 cups)]] if using.

3. Gradually mix in [[all-purpose flour (10 to 12 cups, as needed)]] until the dough is soft and no longer sticky. Lightly oil your hands or the counter if needed.

4. Roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Spread with [[butter, melted]], then sprinkle evenly with [[granulated sugar]] and [[ground cinnamon]]. Roll up tightly and slice into 1-inch pieces.

5. Place rolls on greased baking sheets, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour (or bake sooner if you prefer a shorter rise).

6. Bake at 400°F for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden.

7. Beat [[butter, softened]] and [[cream cheese, softened]] until smooth. Mix in [[vanilla extract]], then add [[powdered sugar]] and [[milk]] until the frosting is spreadable. Frost the rolls while warm.
