1. In a wide bowl you can dip the flat side of the bread slices in, mix together all the butter mixture ingredients:

- [[butter]]
- [[olive oil]]
- [[smoked paprika]]
- [[salt]]
- [[pepper]]

2. Pour about a spoonful of the butter mixture into a pan and heat to medium, medium-low. (The perfect temperature will make the butter foamy but not boil).

3. Cut a wide hole in the center of [[thick-sliced homemade bread]].

4. Dip both sides of the bread in the butter mixture french toast style and toast both sides until golden brown (about 30 seconds to a minute). This keeps the bread crisp and prevents sogginess.

5. To the side of the toasted piece of break, sprinkle the parmesan cheese directly onto the skillet so it makes a rectangle about the side of the toast. Let it melt for about 10 seconds, then place and gentle press the bread into the cheese to form a crisp parmesan crust.

6. Reduce heat slightly and crack the egg into the hole.

7. Sprinkle remaining [[freshly grated parmesan cheese]] on the bread surface (avoid covering the yolk). Cover the skillet and cook 2–3 minutes, until the egg is set to your liking.

8. If it looks like the bread is a little light on seasonings, top off with another pinch of [[salt]], [[black pepper]], and or [[smoked paprika]].
