1. **Make the dough:** In a large bowl, whisk yeast into warm water and let sit 1 minute. Whisk in salt, sugar, and melted butter. Gradually stir in 3 cups of flour (1 cup at a time) until dough is thick; add ¾ cup more flour until it’s no longer sticky (up to an additional ¼–½ cup if needed). Dough should bounce back when poked.

2. Knead in a stand mixer with dough hook for 5 minutes (or by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes), adding flour teaspoon-by-teaspoon if it sticks. Dough should be soft and pass the windowpane test (thin stretch without tearing).

3. Shape dough into a ball, cover lightly with a towel, and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C) and line two baking sheets with silicone mats or greased parchment.

4. **Shape pretzels:** Divide dough into 1/3-cup pieces (about 75 g each). Roll each into a 20–22 inch rope, form a circle, twist the ends together, then press them down to create the classic pretzel shape.

5. Bring the baking-soda bath to a boil. Drop 1–2 pretzels into boiling water for 20–30 seconds, then lift with a slotted spatula, letting excess water drip off. Transfer to prepared sheets and sprinkle with coarse salt. The pretzels dry really fast, so instead of salting them one at a time, you can egg wash them then salt.

6. Bake for 12–15 minutes, until golden brown.

7. Serve warm with your favorite dip. I recommend spicy nacho cheese.
