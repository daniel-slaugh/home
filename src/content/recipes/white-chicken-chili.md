1. Select the Sauté function on the Instant Pot. Heat the [[vegetable oil]].

2. Add the [[onion, finely chopped]] and sauté for 3–4 minutes.

3. Pour in the [[chicken broth]] and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned bits.

4. Stir in:

- [[Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed]]
- [[corn, drained]]
- [[diced green chilies, with juices]]
- [[cumin]]
- [[salt]]
- [[black pepper]]
- [[garlic powder]]

5. Add the [[boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thirds]]. Press Cancel to stop sautéing.

6. Close and lock the lid. Set the pressure/steam release to Sealing. Cook for 18 minutes on high pressure. Allow 14 minutes for the pot to come to pressure.

7. Once cooking ends, let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release the remaining pressure.

8. While pressure releases, whisk together [[water]] and [[cornstarch]] to form a slurry.

9. Remove the chicken with tongs and shred using two forks. Set aside.

10. Select the Sauté function again. Stir in the [[sour cream]] until melted and combined.

11. Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Return the shredded chicken to the pot and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Press Cancel.

12. Serve in bowls and top with shredded Monterey Jack cheese.
